    <h3 class="mt-8 mb-4 text-lg font-bold">SSL or TLS encryption</h3>
    <p>
      This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and for the
      protection of the transmission of confidential content, such as the
      inquiries you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an
      encrypted connection in your browser’s address line when it changes from
      “http://” to “https://” and the lock icon is displayed in your browser’s
      address bar. If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transfer
      to us generally cannot be read by third parties.

    <h3 class="mt-8 mb-4 text-lg font-bold">Inquiry by e-mail or telephone</h3>
    <p>
      If you contact us by e-mail or telephone, your inquiry including all
      resulting personal data (name, inquiry details, contact information) will
      be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request.
      We do not pass on this data without your consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR if your
      request is related to the performance of a contract or is necessary for
      the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the
      processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing
      of the requests sent to us (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR) or on your consent (Art.
      6 (1) (a) GDPR) if this has been requested; the consent can be revoked at
      any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data you send to us via contact requests will remain with us until you
      request us to delete it, revoke your consent to store it, or the purpose
      for storing the data no longer applies (e.g., after your request has been
      processed). Mandatory legal provisions - in particular legal retention
      periods - remain unaffected.
